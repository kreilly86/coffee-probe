#### LOGO
<hr>
<br>
The logo was made using canva, and this particular template:
<br>

[Logo Template](https://www.canva.com/design?create&type=TAB7AVEOUWQ&template=EADZ4KRPdc0&category=tACZCvjI6mE&analyticsCorrelationId=b9361aa1-9507-47ab-a858-be3cdb5a90b6&schema=web-2)
<br>
The logo has a sleek look and is instantly recognisable as an espresso machine. The logo font

[Major Mono Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Major+Mono+Display#standard-styles) is suited to a quiz format, with its' constructivist design, it is bold and striking. The logo is consistent in style and size throughout the application, for a seamless user experience.

#### INTRO MESSAGE AND BEGIN BUTTON
<hr>
<br>
On the homepage there is a simple welcome message to the quiz user displayed in a box below the logo. I have used the same font as the logo for consistency. The message is short and to the point "Welcome to Coffee Probe. Test your coffee knowledge". The user has no question as to the theme of the quiz. 
<br>
Below the welcome message there is a button displaying "Let's begin" which will load a pop-up for the user to input their details.

#### USER DETAILS POP-UP
<hr>
<br>
The user pop-up form allows the user to input their name and email. The intial plan for this data was to implement sessionStorage for the input. I ran out of time to go back and do this, so would defintely improve on this in the future, and be able to use prompts with the users name, and when I declare their results.

#### LEVEL BUTTONS
<hr>
<br>
On submitting the users' details they are taken to the quiz levels page, where they can select easy, intermediate or expert questions.

I have included a hover effect on the buttons. When the user hovers over one of the buttons the text color changes to white, to make the user experience more dynamic.

#### QUIZ SECTION
<hr>
<br>
Once the user has selected a level they are taken to the quiz page and the first question is rendered. The quiz section is made up of a few different elements. The nav button and logo remain in the same place as the previous pages. There is a progress bar which shows the user the percentage of the quiz they have completed. Below this is the quiz question with three possible answers. When the user hovers over an answer a gold background color effect is displayed. Once they have clicked on their choice the next question is rendered, and the progress bar is updated. Below this section is also a running score tally which will update the scores as the answers are calculated.

### FEATURES FOR FUTURE INCLUSION
<hr>
<br>
There are a lot of things I would have liked to include in the quiz if I had to do it again. Some of these are as follows:
<br>
- A timer to limit the amount of time the user has to answer
- Have the whole project run on one or two html pages, rather than have to link them all
- Alerts to display when the user has answered incorrectly and what the correct answer is
- An education section where the user can go to find further learnign resources
